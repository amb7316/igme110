            <h2>A Little Bit About Me, College Edition</h2>
            <p> What's up guys, my name is Andrew, I'm 19, and I learned how to read in elementary school. I'm a first-year transfer student at <abbr title="Rochester Institute of Technology">RIT</abbr>. My current major is Game Design and Development, hence why I made this website in the first place. I'm originally from Greece, New York, which is about 20 minutes away from RIT. On campus, I'm involved in two simultaneous campaigns of a tabletop RPG called <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/essentials"><i>Dungeons & Dragons</i></a>, as well as a third campaign that is done over Discord with a few friends. When I'm not playing <i><abbr title="Dungeons & Dragons"></abbr>D&D</i>, doing homework, or being in class. I can usually be found in my dorm playing video games, procrastinating on my current assignments. I particularly enjoy playing <i>Team Fortress 2</i>, <i>Terraria</i>, <i>Pok√©mon</i>, and the <i>Elder Scrolls</i> franchise (I'm currently playing through <i>Oblivion</i>). Like most RIT students, I religiously engage in riding a bike to get around campus and eating Salsarita's Mexican Grill. For the most part, I'm an academically successful student, but as previously stated I occasionally have some...time management issues. Despite my tendency to procrastinate, I still am able to complete my assignments in a timely fashion and at a quality that I can be proud of.

            <h2>A Little Bit About Me 2, Electric Boogaloo</h2>
            <p>If you remember the second sentence of my first paragraph, I mentioned that I am a transfer student. "Why did you transfer?", you might ask. Excellent question reader, we'll delve into it right now. I originally attended <abbr title= "State University of New York">SUNY</abbr> University at Buffalo (also called UB, yayyyyy more acronyms) in the fall and spring of 2018. While I attended <abbr title="University at Buffalo">UB</abbr>, I had changed my major <u><abbr title="Musical Theatre, Chemistry, Computer Science">multiple times</abbr></u> and I was still feeling like I couldn't see myself in a fulfilling career after I graduated. I had always had a curiosity for how games were made and I enjoyed used my creativity, so when I was looking for colleges to transfer to, I looked at RIT for it's Game Design and Development program. Combined with the opportunities provided by <abbr title="Cooperative Education">Co-ops</abbr> and the pleasant atmosphere, I decided to enroll at RIT. Looking back, the decision to enroll at RIT was an excellent choice, since I'm enjoying my college experience infinitely more as well as getting a respectable education in a field I am passionate about. I hope that this passion keeps burning here at RIT. Go Tigers!
